# Prompt Engineering Analysis Report for EdTech Math Tutor

## Overview
This report analyzes the effectiveness of different prompting strategies for an EdTech Math Tutor designed for students in grades 6-10. The analysis compares zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and meta-prompting approaches across various mathematical tasks and concepts.

## Methodology

### Test Dataset
- 10 representative questions covering different grade levels (6-10)
- Topics include: algebra, geometry, word problems, and concept explanations
- Questions designed to test both computational and explanatory capabilities

### Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy (0-3 points)
   - Correctness of mathematical solutions
   - Proper application of formulas
   - Appropriate use of units

2. Reasoning Clarity (0-3 points)
   - Step-by-step explanation quality
   - Logical flow of solutions
   - Grade-appropriate language

3. Hallucination Score (0-3 points)
   - Factual consistency
   - Mathematical precision
   - Avoidance of false concepts

4. Consistency (0-3 points)
   - Uniform solution structure
   - Consistent notation usage
   - Reliable performance across topics
